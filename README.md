Code Studio Piskel
======

[![Travis Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/code-dot-org/piskel.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/code-dot-org/piskel)

This is a custom version of the excellent [Piskel Editor](https://github.com/juliandescottes/piskel) by [@juliandescottes](https://github.com/juliandescottes) and [@grosbouddha](https://github.com/grosbouddha), designed for embedded use with the Code.org Code Studio learning platform.  For more information on using or developing Piskel, please see [the main repository](https://github.com/juliandescottes/piskel).

## Local Development Setup

Note: To run local integration tests you should install CasperJS 1.0.2 (not included as a dependency in this repo) and make sure it has access to PhantomJS 1.9.2 (downloaded to node_modules/.bin on `npm install` but not necessarily in your PATH).
